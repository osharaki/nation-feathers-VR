3 LEAF PRODUCTIONS - NATHAN LEE
ROCK-WOOD SFX (FREE VERSION)

Thank you for downloading this sound effects pack created by Nathan Lee of 3 Leaf Productions.
This pack includes a small collection of various sound of rocks, sticks/wood of varying sizes, being dropped, broken or hit
and on a few different surfaces.  

Here is a brief explanation of the file naming system I use.  Take the filename - med_rock_land_gravel_01
the first word up to the underscore describes the general size of the object so in this case med which most would 
understand as meaning "medium". The second word is the actual primary material used, so in this case "rock" but 
more specifically - "medium sized rocks". The nex word describes the action being performed, meaning so far we have -  
a medium-sized rock, landing. Lastly, is the material the primary object is interacting with, so now we have - 
a medium-sized rock, landing in gravel. The number at the end is just which variation of the sounds you're listening to.
Hopefully this method makes it easier to find the sounds you want by knowing in a way ahead of time what the sound is 
attempting to emulate.  If you like the sounds in this pack, you can always check out the other versions of this pack that
contain a wider variety of materials and variations.  Thanks again for your support.
